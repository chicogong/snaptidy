# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.9.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Quality assessment** (`assess_quality.py`) — Compute blur (Laplacian variance),
  brightness (mean pixel intensity), contrast (standard deviation), and composite
  quality score (0-100) for each image. Results stored in DB columns `blur_score`,
  `brightness`, `contrast`, `quality_score`. Integrated with `generate_move_plan.py`
  (blur penalty + quality bonus for `--strategy quality`) and `generate_review.py`
  (quality badge + "Keep best quality" strategy). Supports `--incremental` mode.
  Numpy for fast computation, PIL fallback without numpy.
- **Live Photo detection** (`detect_live_photos.py`) — Identify iPhone Live Photo
  pairs (HEIC+MOV with matching base filename in same directory). Writes
  `live_photo_group` column to DB so dedup tools keep pairs together.
- **Orphan RAW cleanup** (`find_orphan_raw.py`) — Find RAW files without a JPEG
  companion in the same directory (or vice versa with `--both`). Useful for
  photographers who shoot RAW+JPEG and want to clean up orphans.
- **Timeline viewer** (`generate_timeline.py`) — Interactive HTML page with
  zoomable year → month → day timeline, category filters (photo/screenshot/wechat/
  burst/video), quality badges, and responsive layout. Standalone HTML, no server.
- **Library comparison** (`compare_libraries.py`) — Compare Photos.app library
  against file-system folder by SHA-256 hash (definitive) and filename (approximate).
  Find photos only in library, only on disk, or shared between both.
- **Google Takeout import** (`import_google_takeout.py`) — Scan Google Photos
  Takeout exports, find JSON sidecar metadata files, merge date/GPS/description
  into photo EXIF. Optionally import into Photos.app. Handles Google's various
  sidecar naming conventions.
- **GPX geotagging** (`gpx_geotag.py`) — Assign GPS coordinates to photos without
  location data by matching EXIF timestamps against GPX track points. Uses linear
  interpolation between adjacent trackpoints. Supports `--tolerance`,
  `--timezone-offset`, `--write-exif`, and `--dry-run`.
- **Event clustering** (`cluster_events.py`) — Auto-group photos into events
  by time gap (default 4h) and optionally by location (city changes start new event).
  Generates event names like "Beijing (2025-06-15)". Can write `event_id` back to DB.
- **Video dedup** (`find_similar_videos.py`) — Find duplicate/similar videos
  using frame sampling (ffmpeg) + perceptual hash comparison. Supports configurable
  frame count, similarity threshold, and Hamming distance. Requires ffmpeg.
- **Smart rename** (`rename_photos.py`) — Rename photos using configurable templates
  with metadata tokens: `{date}`, `{time}`, `{camera}`, `{city}`, `{seq}`, `{original}`.
  Dry-run by default, collision-safe, undo record on execute.
- **"Keep best quality" strategy** in `generate_review.py` — New smart strategy
  option that selects the photo with the highest `quality_score` to keep.
- **Quality score integration** in `generate_move_plan.py` — `--strategy quality`
  now considers blur penalty and quality_score bonus when scoring duplicates.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Reverse geocoding** (`reverse_geocode.py`) — Convert GPS coordinates to place names
  (city/region/country) with 3 backends: CoreLocation (macOS offline, fastest),
  Locationator (macOS HTTP API), Nominatim (online, always available). Auto-detects
  best backend. Persistent JSON cache with 3-decimal-place rounding (~111m precision)
  alongside the output DB.
- **EXIF editing** (`edit_exif.py`) — Modify photo metadata with 3 operations:
  `strip-gps` (remove GPS data from indexed photos), `set-date` (set EXIF capture date),
  `set-tags` (write keywords/tags). Uses piexif for JPEG/TIFF with exiftool fallback
  for HEIC/RAW. Backup/restore safety: `.bak` files created before modification, cleaned
  on success, restored on error. `--dry-run` and `--no-backup` flags.
- **By-location organization** — `organize_photos.py --mode by-location` organizes photos
  into `Country/Region/City/filename` folder structure using reverse-geocoded place names.
  Falls back to GPS coordinate zones (1-degree grid ≈ 111km) when no place data available.
- **Location stats in library health** — `library_stats.py` now includes `by_location`
  breakdown showing top cities by photo count. Terminal output shows top 15 cities;
  HTML report includes a dedicated `📍 地点分布` section with purple color theme.
- **Geocode integration in scan** — `scan_photos.py` and `scan_photos_library.py` now
  perform reverse geocoding by default, populating `place_city`, `place_region`,
  `place_country`, `place_country_code` columns. Use `--no-geocode` to disable.
  Geocode cache initialized at scan start, flushed at scan end.
- **SQLite schema migration** — New columns added via `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`
  (backward compatible): `place_city`, `place_region`, `place_country`,
  `place_country_code`. New indexes: `idx_place_city`, `idx_place_country`.

### Changed
- `organize_photos.py` `by-location` mode was previously a stub — now fully functional.
- `scan_photos.py` and `scan_photos_library.py` signatures changed: added
  `geocode: bool = True` parameter.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Library health & insights** (`library_stats.py`) — read-only report with
  totals, category/format/year breakdowns, health flags (screenshots, no-EXIF,
  GPS/privacy, iCloud-only, possibly-blurry, favorites) and top space consumers.
  Three outputs: terminal, `--format json`, `--report` HTML. Also wired as
  `organize_photos.py --mode stats`.
- HTML before/after diff report for `--mode photos-album` (new/changed/unchanged
  albums with photo-count deltas), works under `--dry-run` too.
- Organized output directory structure: `scan/`, `plans/`, `reports/`, `logs/`.

### Changed
- **Refactor: extracted shared modules** eliminating ~600 lines of duplication —
  `photo_metadata.py` (hashing/EXIF/pHash/size), `constants.py`
  (extensions/format-family/epoch/month-names/album-maps/`format_size`),
  `applescript_utils.py` (escaping + osascript).
- **Standardized CLI flags** across all scripts (backward-compatible aliases):
  `--source` canonical for photo source (was `--input`/`--library`); `--index`
  (`-i`) for the index DB; `--output` (`-o`, also `--report`) for outputs.

### Fixed
- Album separator contract: `scan_photos_library.py` wrote `"; "` but every
  consumer split on `","` — broke `--prefer-album`/`--album-filter` for
  multi-album photos. Unified to `,`.
- `import_to_photos.py` share workflow: Python f-string referenced an
  AppleScript variable (`thePhotos`) → `NameError`. Fixed to AppleScript.
- `apply_move_plan.move_to_trash()` interpolated paths into AppleScript without
  escaping (injection risk) — now uses shared `escape_applescript()`.
- Album name emoji drift between organizer (`🎬`) and report (`📹`) — unified
  via shared `constants.CATEGORY_ALBUM_NAMES`.
- `--dry-run` album report showed 0 photos / empty diff — now populates
  `added`/`existed` details and simulates before/after album state.
- HTML report paths now absolute so the browser reliably opens them.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Import photos from external drives/Android into Photos.app with automatic dedup (`import_to_photos.py`)
- Shared album reading from Photos.sqlite
- iCloud sync awareness — detect iCloud-only files and download status
- Checkpoint & resume for import workflow (`--resume` flag + `import_checkpoint.json`)

### Fixed
- `apply_move_plan.py` — undo was completely broken; `save_undo_record()` now called at end of `main()`
- `apply_move_plan.py` — skipped stats double-counting; photos-trash per-file status tracking
- `generate_preview.py` — XSS prevention via `html.escape()`
- `generate_preview.py` — added `--max-groups` parameter (default 500) to prevent huge HTML files
- `import_to_photos.py` — SIGINT/SIGTERM handler to save checkpoint on Ctrl+C
